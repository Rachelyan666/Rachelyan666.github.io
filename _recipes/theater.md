**In Progress**

In theater productions, a follow spot is often used to highlight the lead actor on stage. Traditionally, this spotlight is manually controlled, which can be labor-intensive and may not always keep up with fast-moving performances. To solve this problem, our team is developing an automated actor tracking spotlight system that can follow the actor in real-time without human control.

Our project uses a Raspberry Pi and infrared tracking techniques to detect the actor's position on stage. The actor is equipped with an infrared-emitting marker, and sensors or Pi-compatible NoIR cameras are used to detect the IR signal. The position data is then processed to calculate the actorâ€™s location and send commands to a motorized spotlight to pan and tilt accordingly. This system aims to improve spotlight accuracy and reduce manual operation in live theater environments.
