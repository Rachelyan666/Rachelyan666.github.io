In general, our system works by sending tidal data from the NXP FRDM-KL46Z board using skills we learned this semester, and then use the arduino to receive and process the data, which finally controlls the LED strip to turn on and off showcasing the tide.

In this project, we accomplished and practices a lot of skills that we learn in this class. For example, in hardware, we practiced wire soldering a lot in the project. Then, in the FRDM-KL46Z code, we accomplished sending data using UART serial communication, as well as the real-time scheduling that we learned by the end of the semester. Finally, in Arduino code, we accomplished receiving data in UART, as well as data decode and other programming skills.
