# Hello and Welcome!

I'm Rachel, a student from Cornell University double majoring in **Electrical & Computer Engineering** and **Computer Science**. My focus is mainly *Computer Architecture* and *Embedded Systems*. Previously, I have interned at *JP Morgan Chase* as an engineering intern, and have been a student research assistant in Cornell's *CSL (computer systems lab)*. On campus I have also completed various ECE project on my own or as a team with other students.

Currently, I am a senior student, and hope to work in the industry mainly on RTL designing and testing or embedded systems engineering.
