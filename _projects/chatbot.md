This project implements a conversational assistant for game Stardew Valley, built using Python, the Autograms AI chatbot framework, and OpenAIâ€™s API. 

The chatbot provides players with quick access to in-game knowledge through natural dialogue, acting as a guide for important mechanics. It covers areas such as villager gifts (including universal likes and loves), money-making strategies, fishing information, and crafting or cooking recipes, allowing players to ask questions and receive detailed answers in real time.

The project demonstrates techniques for building interactive dialogue systems, combining structured prompts with domain-specific knowledge retrieval. Users can query the bot in different modes, such as calculating required resources to reach a gold target, listing available fish given in-game conditions, or identifying how to obtain recipes. The modular design makes the chatbot extensible, showcasing practical integration of game data with conversational AI for an engaging user experience.
