This project implements an AI agent built to play Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, implemented in Python with a AI algorithms and Pygame-based graphical interface.

The project explores classic game AI techniques including Minimax search, Alpha-Beta pruning, and heuristic evaluation functions tailored for the unique rules of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe. The AI is capable of playing strategically on both the macro and micro boards, adapting to changing board states and forcing favorable positions. The rules of valid move restrictions and win propagation are fully enforced.

Users can play against the AI in an interactive GUI and toggle between different levels of difficulty. The project also includes testing infrastructure and tools for analyzing AI performance over multiple games.
