    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p> I was born and raised in Shanghai, where in the childhood and school years over there, I developed strong interests in <strong>STEM</strong>, such as coding, website creation, and also physics. After coming to Cornell, I gradually explored my interest, and found my major: <strong>Electrical and computer engineering</strong> (will be shorten as ECE in the following contents).</p>
     <p>ECE is a very <strong>interdisciplinary subject</strong>, and really allows me to explore both of the hardware and the software side of technology development, which is exactly what I love to do.</p>
     <p>I found my passion in leaerning how to utilize my knowledge and skills to make life easier for everyone and the society.</p>
     <p>Currently, as a sophmore student, I am still exploring my career, and hope that with my skills and passion, I would be able to find a career that I love one day.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
<p>Besides studying as an engineer, there are also plenty of other things that I enjoy doing, such as travelling, solving rubik's cubes, making videos, etc.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of <strong>rubik's cube</strong> and have several of them in my dorm, and a lot more at home. I love solving them, as I think they gave me a kind of inspiration of challenging myself and looking at things in a different way. Not only am I interested in solving it, I am also interested in solving them in different shapes and how to solve them really fast!</p>

<p>In addition, I really enjoy <strong>video making</strong>, which I beleive is a good way of spreading ideas and contents. I used to make a few videos for my parents, and then I gradually came to make videos for my intersts, such as anime and music videos. I am still learning how to use more professional ways to edit these videos.</p>

<p>I am also a person who really enjoyed <strong>travelling</strong>. I have been to several different countries, such as Australia, Japan, Canada, etc. I have really seen a lot of different views and I do think that travelling could help me see more part of the world, and broden my horizon.</p>
