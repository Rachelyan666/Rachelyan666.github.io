        <p class="project start">During my time in university, I have done several meaningful and interesting projects,
            here are some of those I am most pround of.</p>



        <section>
            <h2>Software Projects:</h2>
            <h3>1. Alien Shooting Flash Game</h3>
            <p class="project">This project is a game written by python and pygame that allows the space ship to shoot
                the aliens. </p>
            <p class="project">What we are supposed to create, is a game that includes one player, which is shown as a
                spaceship in the game
                There is going to be a group of aliens, alinged in a group, and they are the enemies that we will need
                to kill.
                The spaceship have some bullets that could be shooted out, and these bullets could kill the aliens.
                There are also several GUI and some other resitrictions in the game that we will need to implement in
                order for it to be working correctly.</p>

            <p class="project">The code itself contains around 1000 lines of code, and they are broken up into several
                different modules, such as the wave, which is to control each wave of aliens, the model class, which is
                the basic settings for the spaceship, alliens and the bullets. Finally there is also an app module,
                which is the general controller of the application.</p>

            <h3>2. LTL interpreter</h3>
            <p class="project">This project is a interpreter written by Ocaml that transfers a natural language that
                follows LTL rules into an automata graph. </p>
            <p class="project">This is a tool that can translate everyday language into something a machine understands.
                LTL logic, which is the Linear Temporal Language (LTL) will be transformed into Büchi Automata.</p>

            <p class="project">This converter takes in strictly-formatted human language, parses and synthesizes it into
                a simplified Linear Temporal Logic expression, and converts it into a reliable Büchi automaton that is
                visualized and verifiable. With the automaton being generated, the user is able to verify if their
                subsequent tentative actions is executable.</p>

            <h2>Electrical projects:</h2>

            <h3>1. Tide Clock </h3>
            <p class="project">
                In general, our system works by sending tidal data from the FRDM-KL46Z board using skills
                we learned this semester, and then use the arduino to receive and process the data, which finally
                controlls the LED strip to turn on and off showcasing the tide.
            </p>
            <p class="project">
                In this project, we accomplished and practices a lot of skills that we learn in this class. For example,
                in hardware, we practiced wire soldering a lot in the project. Then, in the FRDM-KL46Z code, we
                accomplished
                sending data using UART serial communication, as well as the real-time scheduling that we learned by
                the end of the semester. Finally, in Arduino code, we accomplished receiving data in UART, as well as
                data decode and other programming skills.

            <h3>2. Embedded Mahjong Player</h3>
            <p class="project">
                Mahjong is a type of Chinese board game where four players are required for a game. Often times, people
                find it hard to always find four people for the game, often there are only three. Therefore, it became a
                problem
                that a fourth player is needed. To solve this problem, our team worked on the embedded mahjong player,
                so that
                it can play along as the extra player to help start the game.
            </p>

            <p class="project">
                Our project first uses the Pi Camera to take photos of Mahjong tiles, and uses the photos to train the
                computer
                vision model, and then uses the trained model to identify the tiles. Next, the Mahjong algorithm would
                determine
                which tile it should play this round, and send the instruction to the PiTFT and servo to indicate the
                played tile.
                Displays and buttons on the PiTFT are also used as round controls.
