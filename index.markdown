I'm Rachel, a student from Cornell University double majoring in **Electrical & Computer Engineering** and **Computer Science**. My focus is mainly *Computer Architecture* and *Embedded Systems*. Previously, I have interned at *JP Morgan Chase* as an engineering intern, and have been a student research assistant in Cornell's *CSL (computer systems lab)*. On campus I have also completed various ECE project on my own or as a team with other students.

Currently, I am a senior student, and hope to work in the industry mainly on RTL designing and testing or embedded systems engineering.

## Certifications and Projects

During my down time, I like to work on projects to keep up with tech skills, and pursue certifications.

I am a **Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)**, and due for my **Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS)** test soon. 

My current side project is a *Telegram bot* running on a *Raspi Zero* that I use to track my progress at the gym! The data is stored locally in MongoDB, and I am working on designing a suitable visualisation board on Grafana.
